			<p> I arrived to Lithuania on 1st of July 2016, and participated in language course hosted by LCC called SLI (Summer Language Institute), a three-week
				intensive English course. Afterwards, I had the oppurtunity to tutor a Lithunian girl in Enlish instructions. It lasted for about 4 months and then
				I could not manage my schedule to match hers. Therefore, had to stop it</p>

			<p> I had some time to concentrate on my studies and was able to excel my English language. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class= "text3">
			<p> Right after I finished my first semester at LCC, I was offered to administer TOEFL IBT tests that are held monthly in LCC. I was trained on how to 
			host the test and how to connect the computers to the test. I learned a lot on how remote control work and how the tests are held. Also, for the first time
			I became the supervisor and not the test-taker. A very interesting viewpoint comes with a lot of responsibilities and at the ready to solve any technical issues
			that might occur. </p>

			<p> I still administer TOEFL IBT tests until this time and had more offers along with it. </p>

		<div class= "text5">
			<p> I expressed my passion for computers and software throughout my whole first semester. After the first smester as well, in December, 2016,
				I was offered an oppurtunity to intern for the Communications Office at LCC as a webmaster. I was assigned multible projects as a requirment to
				join the team. Unfortunately, I could not really finish on time, for that was the first time I use WordPress, and first time writing code--I had 
				mid-term exams at that time. However I finished one project for the Admissions Office and was published on the website. <b>

		<div class= "text6">
			<p> Then, I decided to take it down for sometime and focus on my personal life for some time. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class= "text7">
			<p> After a the second semester passed by with fairly good academic competence, I started looking for summer internships or jobs.
				I was given contacts to a company that designs websites in the same city I am residing in, Klaipeda. I went and had a meeting with the manager.
				He was really understanding and adviced me what to focus on before the internship. Unfortunately, he had all spots for interns taken, and I 
				had to wait for someone to leave. I then was told that there are opennings at a company that works with cryptocurrencies. For the sake 
				of trying, I applied even though I knew nothing about cryptocurrencies. I got the job on the first of August 2017. I am still on top of my 
				job and able to multitask more than I ever thought I would be. I have learned a lot about online banking and cryptocurrencies. Fairly succeeded in
				building capacity to handle the pressure of complaints and angry clients. I am able now to chat with six clients concurrently. </p>

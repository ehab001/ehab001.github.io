			<p> After maintaining my computer shop for about three years, I knew it was the main thing that interests me. I was amazed by many things 
				regarding how they work and function, design and animation. I am mostly interested in programming and coding. I spent hundreds of hours online 
				taking online courses on C source code, Java, Python, C++. Additionally, I was introduced to web coding and was curious how that works. I 
				started by looking at basic HTML and tried myself creating some "websites". It was nothing without CSS and JavaScript. Therefore, I started understandoing the
				concepts of the both previously mentioned languages. I can say I can handle CSS by now and edit it when needed. However, I did not really have
				a lot of time to familiarize myself with JavaScript well. It is still on my to-do list though. I self-tought myself photoshop and pretty much 
				intermediate features of it. I enjoyed designing even though I never had the opportunity to do it professionally. I also enjoyed combining 
				design with animations and as a result, I got addicted to MS PowerPoint, Prezi, etc. <br /> To summarize all this, I am fond of computers 
				and every single thing related to them. </p>

			<p> One of the photos I like the most is this one that was designed for an event my best friend, MILAD AL-KALLAS and I organized. We stayed up 
				weeks to get the event organized (hosted by LCC International University), for we knew there would come at least 150 people. We desingend the brochures and everything from A-Z.
				We have had a lot of great of reactions and feedback.</p>

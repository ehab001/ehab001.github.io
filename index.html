				<h1> About Me </h1><br />
				<p> My name is Ehab Abaideen, and I am a sophomore at LCC International Universityâ€“I study Contemporary Communications. <br />
				In the past, I had my own computer shop in my home, Syria, and worked there for about three years and gained valuable skills and experiences.<br /> 
				I moved to Turkey in 2015 seeking other opportunities and better life circumstances and worked in multiple fields, yet I was not fully satisfied. <br />
				As a result, I sought to take one more step towards my education.<br /> Additionally, I am whole-heartedly fond design and animations.
				I spend tens of hours per PowerPoint presentation just for the sake of making it most compelling.
				At LCC, I had the opportunity to work as webmaster intern in the communications office and done multiple projects for the communications office and admissions office.<br /> 
				I am currently working as Customer Support Specialist in a cryptocurrency company called SpectroFinance. </p>

				<h1> About Me </h1><br />
				<p> My name is Ehab Abaideen, and I am a sophomore at LCC International University--I study Contemporary Communications. <br />
				In the past, I had my own computer shop in my home, Syria, and worked there for about three years and gained valuable skills and experiences.<br /> 
				I moved to Turkey in 2015 seeking other opportunities and better life circumstances,  and worked in multible fields, yet I were not fully satisfied. <br />
				 As a result, I sought to take one more step towards my education.<br /> Additionally, I am whole-heartedly fund in design and animations. I spend tens of hours per PowerPoint presentation just for the sake of making it most compelling. </p>
				 <p4> At LCC, I had the opportunity to work as webmaster intern in the communications office and done multible projects for the communications office and addmissions office.<br /> 
				I am currently working as Costumer Support Specialist in a cryptocurrency company called SpectroFinance </p4>
